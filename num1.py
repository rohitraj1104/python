num1 = 10
num2 = 2.5

type(num1)  # checking the type of this variable; integer
type(num2)  # checking the type of this variable; float

# Numbers - math operations
1 + 2  # addition

2 â€“ 1  # subtraction

4 / 2  # division

4 * 2  # multiplication

4 ** 2  # raising to a power

5 % 2  # modulo (this means finding out the remainder after division of one number by another)

# Numbers - float division vs. integer division (special case)
3 / 2  # float division; result is 1 in Python 2 and 1.5 in Python 3

3 // 2  # integer division; result is 1 in Python 2 and Python 3

# Numbers - order of evaluation in math operations
# Highest priority: raising to a power; Medium priority: division, multiplication and modulo; Low priority: addition and subtraction
100 - 5 ** 2 / 5 * 2  # 1st: 5 ** 2, second: / then *, third - ; result is 90.0

# Numbers - conversion between numeric types
int(1.5)  # result is 1

float(2)  # result is 2.0

# Numbers - useful functions
abs(5)  # the distance between the number in between parantheses and 0

abs(-5)  # returns the same result as abs(5)

max(1, 2)  # returns the largest number

min(1, 2)  # returns the smallest number

pow(3, 2)  # another way of raising to a power

# Booleans - logical operations
(1 == 1) and (
            2 == 2)  # result is True; AND means that both operands should be True in order to get the expression evaluated as True

(1 == 1) or (
            2 == 2)  # result is True; when using OR, it is enough if only one expression is True, in order to have True as the final result

not (
            1 == 1)  # result is False; using the NOT operator means denying an expression, in this case denying a True expression

not (
            1 == 2)  # result is True; using the NOT operator means denying an expression, in this case denying a False expression

None, 0, 0.0, 0L, 0j, empty
string, empty
list, empty
tuple, empty
dictionary  # these values always evaluate to False

bool(None)  # returns False; function that evaluates values and expressions

bool(0)  # returns False; function that evaluates values and expressions

bool(2)  # returns True; function that evaluates values and expressions

bool("router")  # returns True; function that evaluates values and expressions
