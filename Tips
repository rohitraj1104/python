#regex Tips   Matches the beginning of a line.

$ Matches the end of a line.

\A Matches the beginning of the string.

\z Matches the end of the string.

\Z Matches the end of the string unless the string ends with a "\n", in which case it matches just before the "\n".

So, use \A and lowercase \z. If you use \Z someone could sneak in a newline character. This is not dangerous I think, but might screw up algorithms that assume that there's no whitespace in the string. Depending on your regex and string-length constraints someone could use an invisible name with just a newline character.
